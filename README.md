## We integrated AIRSIM that uses Unreal Game Engine to generate photo-realistic environment and GAZEBO that has physics engines for custumizable vehicle dynamic models.

## The following animated images shows a vehicle in AIRSIM enviornment that has pose calculated from GAZEBO. The GAZEBO simulator is run as SITL with PX autopilot that can be custumized for low level control development.
